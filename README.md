## 🚀 How to Run Locally
1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alpaca-generator.git
   cd alpaca-generator
2.Open index.html in your browser
No server needed — just double-click index.html
Or run a simple local server:

3. Customize your Alpaca!
Click on categories (e.g., Hair, Eyes, Mouth)
Choose different styles from the style buttons
Try the 🎲 Random button
Click ⬇️ Download to save your alpaca as a PNG

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – structure and UI
CSS3 (Flexbox + Grid) – styling and responsive layout
JavaScript (ES6) – dynamic interactivity, randomization, and image export

📱 Responsiveness

Mobile-friendly layout
Buttons and image area adjust gracefully
Works on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari

🧠 How It Works

Each alpaca part (hair, eyes, etc.) is a transparent PNG layer.
When a user selects a style, JavaScript updates the image source for that layer.
When downloading, the app draws all these layers on a hidden <canvas> and saves the result as a .png.

💡 Future Improvements

Add more alpaca accessories and backgrounds
Allow users to upload their own layers
Add “Share” feature for social media
Include dark/light theme toggle
